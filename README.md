# Smart-Street-Light-Monitoring-System

## Overview
The Smart Street Light Monitoring System is designed to modernize outdated street lighting systems in both urban and rural areas. It utilizes light, motion, and weather sensors combined with GSM modules to automate the control of street lights and manage fault reporting. Real-time data collected periodically is analyzed using Wi-Fi and Loran modules, ensuring efficient maintenance, reduced downtime, and minimized energy consumption.

### Key Features
- **Automated Control:** Light sensors (LDRs) enable automatic switching on and off of street lights, enhancing time precision and energy efficiency.
- **Fault Detection:** Current sensors identify issues and report the status to a centralized system via GSM modules, allowing for quick and easy location of faulty lights.
- **Centralized Monitoring:** A centralized database stores data on power consumption, burning hours, interruptions, and fault detection, aiding in performance analysis and maintenance planning.
- **Remote Management:** GSM modules facilitate remote monitoring and control of street lights, ensuring timely repairs and reduced maintenance costs.

#### Benefits
- **Enhanced Public Safety:** Improved visibility and safety for pedestrians and motorists, deterring crime and enhancing the quality of life.
- **Energy Efficiency:** Optimizes power consumption, contributing to environmental sustainability and commercial savings.
- **Economic Growth:** By reducing downtime and enabling timely repairs, the system supports economic activity and overall city prosperity.
- **Sustainability:** Prolongs the lifespan of street lights through optimal sleep scheduling protocols and efficient management practices.

This project transforms traditional street lighting into a responsive, energy-efficient, and environmentally friendly solution, promoting safety, sustainability, and economic benefits.
